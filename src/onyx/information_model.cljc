This function takes at least 4 arguments - the Event map, the old segment before `:onyx/fn` was applied, the new segment after `:onyx/fn` was applied, and the sequence of new segments generated by the old segment. If the old segment generated exactly one segment, and not a sequence of segments, the value of the last parameter will be a collection with only the new segment in it.

                  When denoted as a vector of keywords, the first value in the vector  may either be the keyword `:and`, `:or`, or `:not`, or be a keyword as described above. In the latter case, any subsequent values must be keywords that resolve to keys in the flow condition entries map. The values of these keys are resolved and passed as additional parameters to the function. In the former case, the result of the function (which may again be wrapped with a vector to nest logical operators or parameters), is applied with the designated logical operator. This yields predicate composition."
